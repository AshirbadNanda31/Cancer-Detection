# Cancer-Detection
## Overview

This project implements a Logistic Regression model to classify breast cancer as either Benign or Malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset. The model is trained using scikit-learn and its performance is evaluated based on accuracy on both training and test datasets.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset, which is available in the sklearn.datasets module. It contains 30 numerical features extracted from digitized images of breast tissue samples, along with a binary label:

0 represents Malignant (cancerous)

1 represents Benign (non-cancerous)

The dataset consists of 569 samples, out of which 80% is used for training and 20% for testing.
